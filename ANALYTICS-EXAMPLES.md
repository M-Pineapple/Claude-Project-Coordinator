## üéØ Productive Setup Prompts

### Initial Project Setup
```
"I want to set up project tracking for my iOS development work. I have several SwiftUI projects in ~/Developer and I work on them throughout the week. Please help me add my main projects and set appropriate statuses."
```

### Bulk Project Import
```
"Please scan ~/Developer and add all Xcode projects you find. Set status to 'Active' for any modified in the last 7 days, 'On Hold' for 30+ days, and 'Archived' for 90+ days."
```

### Regular Status Updates
```
"I just finished the authentication flow for TodoApp and I'm moving to push notifications next. Update the project status and add a note about what was completed."
```

### Weekly Review Workflow
```
"It's Friday afternoon. Show me a complete weekly review: activity heat map, projects needing attention, and what I accomplished this week. Then help me plan next week's priorities."
```

### Technology Audit
```
"Analyze my technology usage across all projects. Which frameworks am I using most? Are there any outdated technologies I should migrate away from?"
```

### Project Health Checkup
```
"Do a health check on all my projects. For any critical ones, help me decide whether to archive, revive, or delete them. For healthy ones, what can I do to maintain momentum?"
```

### Sprint Planning Helper
```
"I'm starting a new 2-week sprint. Based on project health and recent activity, which 3 projects should I focus on? Help me set specific goals for each."
```

## üí° Claude Desktop User Preferences

Add these to your Claude Desktop preferences for optimal CPC usage:

### Basic Setup
```
When using Claude Project Coordinator (CPC):
- Always check project health before suggesting what to work on
- Remind me to update project status after discussing implementation details
- When I mention a project name, automatically show its current status
- Flag any project that hasn't been updated in 14+ days
```

### Advanced Workflow
```
CPC Analytics Preferences:
- Every Monday: Show weekly planning view (health report + activity heat map)
- Every Friday: Generate weekly accomplishment summary
- When adding new projects: Auto-detect tech stack and suggest similar projects
- For status updates: Always track the previous status duration
- Alert me when a project stays in "Planning" for more than 7 days
- Suggest archiving projects with 0 activity for 30+ days
```

### Developer Productivity
```
For my development workflow:
- When I say "start working on [project]", show its status, last notes, and pending tasks
- When I say "done for today", summarize what I worked on and update relevant project statuses
- Track which technologies I use most and suggest learning resources for emerging ones
- If I'm stuck on a project for 3+ days, suggest breaking it into smaller tasks
```

### Smart Suggestions
```
Proactive CPC assistance:
- If I mention being busy/overwhelmed, show only my top 3 healthiest active projects
- When starting new projects, warn if I have 5+ projects in "Active Development"
- Suggest "Quick Win" projects (high health, few remaining tasks) when I need motivation
- Friday reminder: "Which projects made progress this week? Let's update their statuses"
```

## üìà Example Conversation Flow

```
You: "Good morning! What should I focus on today?"

## Today's Focus (Based on Analytics)

üéØ **Priority Project**: TodoApp (Health: 92/100)

- 2 remaining tasks: Polish animations, Submit to App Store
- High momentum - let's maintain it!

‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Attention**: NotesSync
